# rustlox
This is my implementation of the Lox tree-walk interpreter described in Robert Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

Lox is a dynamically typed scripting language and it was made by Nystrom for his book.

The first interpreter described in the book is implemented in Java. However, I decided to implement it in Rust to practice and learn more about this language. A lot of my project and "translation" decisions were heavily inspired by [@jeschkies's](https://github.com/jeschkies) [implementation](https://github.com/jeschkies/lox-rs).

## Tests

Almost all of the test samples were taken from the book's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/tree/master/test).
