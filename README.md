# rustlox
This is my implementation of the Lox tree-walk interpreter described in Robert Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

Lox is a dynamically typed scripting language and it was made by Nystrom for his book.

The first interpreter described in the book is implemented in Java. However, I decided to implement it in Rust to practice and learn more about this language.
